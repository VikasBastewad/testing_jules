# Tizen Vendor Test Suite (VTS)

## Overview

The Tizen Vendor Test Suite (VTS) is a collection of tests and tools designed to help device vendors and component suppliers verify the compliance of their Tizen implementations. It aims to ensure that Tizen devices meet the requirements outlined in the Tizen Compliance Specification (TCS), promoting a consistent and robust application environment across the Tizen ecosystem.

This VTS is inspired by the Android Vendor Test Suite (Android VTS) and Tizen's own Tizen Compliance Tests (TCT), providing a framework for testing various aspects of a Tizen device, including Hardware Abstraction Layers (HALs), kernel interfaces, native APIs, and device capabilities.

## Goals

*   **Compliance Verification:** Provide a reliable mechanism for vendors to test their Tizen platform implementations against TCS requirements.
*   **Interoperability:** Help ensure that applications and services run consistently across different Tizen devices.
*   **Quality Assurance:** Assist in identifying issues early in the development cycle.
*   **Extensibility:** Allow for the addition of new tests as Tizen evolves and new hardware features are introduced.

## Architecture (Conceptual)

The Tizen VTS consists of the following key components:

1.  **Test Harness (CLI):** A command-line tool running on a host machine (Linux/macOS/Windows) responsible for:
    *   Discovering available tests.
    *   Deploying test executables to connected Tizen target devices.
    *   Initiating test execution on the target(s).
    *   Collecting test results from the target(s).
    *   Generating human-readable test reports.
2.  **Test Cases:** Individual tests, typically written in C++ using the Google Test (GTest) framework, targeting specific aspects of the Tizen platform:
    *   **HAL Tests:** Verify the correct implementation of Hardware Abstraction Layers.
    *   **Kernel Tests:** Check kernel interfaces, system calls, and `/proc`/`/sys` entries.
    *   **Native API Tests:** Validate the behavior of Tizen's native APIs.
    *   **Device Capability Tests:** Ensure that advertised device capabilities are correctly implemented.
3.  **Helper Scripts:** Shell scripts to assist with building tests, setting up the environment, and managing test execution.
4.  **Tizen Target Device(s):** One or more Tizen devices connected to the host machine via Smart Development Bridge (SDB). Tests are executed directly on these devices.

## Current Status

This Tizen VTS is currently in its foundational stage of development. Core infrastructure, sample tests, and basic harness functionality are being established. It is not yet a complete or production-ready test suite.
